# DevOps For The Desperate

![dftd](book-cover.png "Book front cover")

This repo is about me working through the book [DevOps for the Desperate](https://nostarch.com/devops-desperate).

## Getting Started

If you have access to Linux or Intel based MacOS that would be the simplest solutions. Windows is... windows and arm64 MacOS might work if you can get [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) to emulate a different chip architecture. 

```bash
sudo apt install virtualbox vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```
